            "content": "Slides from today will be uploaded after the lesson . What is a simulation? . A simulation is a way to simulate real-world environments to test safety or logistics. It&#39;s important to use random numbers, consider biases, and consider if a simulation is the best solution. . Why would you make a simulation? . Simulations are useful because they are safe, inexpensive, repeatable, and accurately model how something would be in the real world. Simulations are also useful in predicting how something will happen in future based on previously collected data. . Simulations vs. Experiments . The main difference between simulations and experiments is that simulations replicate real world scenarios digitally while experiments are held in the real world | Simulations usually are less expensive than running an experiment because the expenses needed for acquiring equipment are not present when running a simulation | Since experiments and done in the real world, they provide actual results while simulations use models based on collected data to provide estimations of what is expected to happen | Simulations can provide estimations for events that can&#39;t be recreated in the real world because simulations don&#39;t run the risk of safety issues and they can be done without equipment that would be needed for experimentation | Once created, simulations are easier to repeat to obtain more estimations when compared to experiments because experiments often take a long time to set up and execute | . However, using a simulation is not always the best solution, and you should consider if a simulation is the most cost and time effective solution. Simulations may not be suitable if the circumstances are very complicated or if an experiment would be easier to do. . How do you make a simulation? . At this time, you don&#39;t need to know exactly how to actually make a simulation. However, you do need to know the principals that are important when making one. . What details need to be removed? . In the real world, there is mostly no such thing as &#39;true random.&#39; For example, when rolling dice, things like particles in the air and the velocity of the throw are what really determine what you will roll. However, simulating that would be extremely expensive and unnecessary. What do you think could be used as an alterative to simulating all the factors that decide what you roll? A pseudo-random number generator could be used to randomly roll the dice. However, random numbers are highly important in a variety of situations as well. pseudo-random number generators are used to mock the imperfections that are always in the real world and save resources. You also may remove other details to improve functionality of the simulation. Let&#39;s go back to the flight simulation example. You could add a weather system, taking into account rain, storms, etc. to your simulation. However, it would be easier to instead just run multiple simulations, with a variety of aircraft speeds and visibility. . Example simulation . Skim though the scenario section of this article (it is at the top and includes the diagram). What techniques do you notice he uses? You should consider both ideas from this lesson and from the other college board key ideas. . Some possible answers include: . Procedure and iteration | Flowcharts | Conditionals | Removing details; like accidents or weather | And a lot more! | . Summary of &#39;how&#39; . Key idea: when making a simulation you should consider: . Removing details, which could be done using pseudo-random number generators | Using other ideas from previous college board lessons; like procedure, flowcharts and conditionals | .",

            "content": "CollegeBoard Unit: What is A Simulation? . The actual world—that is, the world outside the screen—is tremendously complicated. Consider an airplane soaring through the sky. Gravity, air density, wind shear, clouds, and precipitation are all environmental elements that impact the aircraft. The plane itself: its shape, weight, wingspan, and materials. Many elements influence how the plane responds to its environment and how the environment responds to the plane. A flight simulator simulates the experience of flying an airplane. Modern flight simulators replicate the terrain and sky outside the plane using computer programs and 3D computer graphics. . . Flight simulators can be quite detailed, but at the end of the day, they are still just simulations. A simulation is a simplified representation of an infinitely complicated natural phenomenon. It eliminates elements that are either unnecessary or too complex to mimic. The level of abstraction in a simulation is determined by the reason for its creation in the first place. When the purpose of a simulation is to enable a pilot train to fly jumbo jets all over the world, the simulation must portray the flying experience in the most realistic way possible. This Boeing 737 flight simulator features a cockpit replica: . . The cockpit is mounted on a platform that can move and rotate in all directions. The simulation of the plane’s movement is an important detail for pilots-in-training, since it helps them deal with disorientation, motion sickness, and the effect of the motion on their ability to adjust the controls. . . A simulation can also help with the development of a new jumbo jet. In that situation, the simulation must capture enough physical data to assist engineers in identifying design faults. Researchers created this simulation of the air flow field surrounding a Boeing 777’s landing gear: . . That flow field contributes significantly to the loudness of an airplane landing. Aircraft designers may use the same simulation with fresh designs to evaluate if their design reduces or increases noise—and ideally choose a design that reduces noise! Simulations can provide hours of amusement. There are many of flight simulation video games available, with many of them centered on warfare or a specific historical air conflict. Although video games are not as precise as simulations used in pilot training, they frequently integrate game aspects that transform the simulation into a more game-like experience. . . Flight simulations can now include highly realistic scenery thanks to the abundance of satellite imagery that is now available. The realism enhances both the educational experience of a pilot in training and the entertainment value of a gamer. . . A simulation can mimic an element of our physical environment, but it also allows us to examine a phenomena without the limits of reality. A pilot can crash without dying, a new plane may be tested before it is manufactured, and a college student can experience what it was like to fly a plane during World War I. Let’s look at some additional simulations and see how they might help us grow in subjects like astronomy, physics, meteorology, and medicine. .",
