It&#39;s important to use random numbers, consider biases, and consider if a simulation is the best solution. . Why would you make a simulation? . A simulation is used to avoid running a experiment or calculation that might be dangerous or costly, by mocking the real-world circumstances digitally. . Is a simulation is the best solution? . However, using a simulation is not always the best solution, and you should consider if a simulation is the most cost and time effective solution. Simulations may not be suitable if the circumstances are very complicated or if an experiment would be easier to do. Consider the following, do you think a simulation or experiment/calculation would be the most effective? . How do you make a simulation? . What details need to be removed? .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
