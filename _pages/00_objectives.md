# CollegeBoard Learning Objectives

**AAP-3.F**: For Simulations: 
- Explain how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes
- Compare Simulations with real-world contexts

# CollegeBoard Essential Knowledge

**AAP-3.F.1**: Simulations are abstractions of more complex objects or phenomena for a specific purpose

**AAP-3.F.2**: A simulation is a representation that uses varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a phenomenon

**AAP-3.F.3**: Simulations often mimic real-world events with the purpose of drawing inferences, allowing investigation of a phenomenon without the constraints of the real world

**AAP-3.F.4**: The process of developing an abstract simulation involves removing specific details or simplifying functionality

**AAP-3.F.5**: Simulations can contain bias derived from the choices of real-world elements that were included or excluded

**AAP-3.F.6**: Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments (e.g., too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous).

**AAP-3.F.7**: Simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration

**AAP-3.F.8**: Random number generators can be used to simulate the variability that exists in the real world
